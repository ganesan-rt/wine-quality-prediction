# WINE -QUALITY-PREDICTION

# OBJECTIVE
Wine quality prediction is the process of using various techniques and models to assess the quality of wine based on its chemical and sensory characteristics. This involves analyzing different attributes of the wine, such as its chemical composition, physical properties, and sensory properties.
