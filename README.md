# WINE -QUALITY-PREDICTION

# OBJECTIVE
Wine quality prediction is the process of using various techniques and models to assess the quality of wine based on its chemical and sensory characteristics. This involves analyzing different attributes of the wine, such as its chemical composition, physical properties, and sensory properties.

# USAGE
<b>1.Prepare your dataset: Download the wine quality dataset and place it in the data/ directory.</b><br>
<b>2.Preprocess the data: Run the data preprocessing script to clean and prepare the dataset for training.</b><br>
<b>3.Train the model: Run the training script to build the wine quality prediction model</b><br>
<b>4.Make predictions: Use the trained model to predict the quality of new wines.</b><br>
 # MODEL
Describe the model architecture and algorithm used for wine quality prediction. You can provide details about the chosen algorithm, its hyperparameters, and any specific considerations taken during model development.
 # EVALUATION
Explain how the model's performance is evaluated. Mention the evaluation metrics used (e.g., Mean Squared Error, Accuracy), and provide insights into the model's accuracy and limitations.
